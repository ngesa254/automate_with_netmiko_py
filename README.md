# automate_with_netmiko_py
I am workin with python using netmiko to automate 3 cisco devices 



I am working with Netmiko 

so i have set 2 cisco c3600 and 1 c3725 routers using GNS3 and they are all configured with seperate ip address which are in same subnet with my pc.


I am using pycharm and will connect to this routers using ssh to config:

-ospf
-configure the interface with ip address.

all configurations are on this repo.


its just a pratice test and i will appreciate feedback and any changes.

over time as i enhance my knowledge with python i will make adjustment to the configurations and push it out for anyone who is also pratising with python & netmiko.


Best Regards!
